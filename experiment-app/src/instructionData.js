      Welcome to this e-learning lesson on manipulative chart descriptions.

        In this module, you will learn how written explanations of visual data can be framed in ways that are technically correct and easy to read, yet still guide you toward misleading conclusions. Even when charts present accurate data, the accompanying description can subtly influence your perception.

        You will be presented with six examples, each consisting of:
         - A chart
         - A deceptive or biased description
         - A detailed explanation of how the description attempts to manipulate your thinking, and how to correctly interpret the chart to avoid being misled

        These manipulative techniques fall into three main categories:
        Inference, Sensationalism, and Oversimplification.
        You will explore each of these in depth on the following pages.

        Please take your time, stay focused, and engage fully with each example.
        Developing these skills will help you become a more critical and confident reader of data.

      Welcome to this e-learning lesson on manipulative descriptions of charts.

        In this module, you will explore how written explanations can intentionally distort the meaning of visual data. Even when a chart presents correct information, its description can be framed to influence your interpretation in subtle (and sometimes deceptive) ways.

        To help you analyze these techniques, each page will provide:
         - An example chart
         - A manipulative description
         - A panel where an AI assistant (LLM) responds to your questions
         - A text field where you can ask your own queries to investigate the example further

        When you open each page, the initial response from the AI assistant (based on a initial predefined prompt) will appear automatically.
        Your task is to use the assistant to dig deeper into how and why the description may be deceptive.

        Interaction rules:
         - The Next button is disabled until you ask at least one question using the Ask button.
         - Your question must be at least 16 characters long.

        Throughout the lesson, you will examine three major manipulation strategies:
        Inference, Sensationalism, and Oversimplification.
        Each will be demonstrated through real examples and guided AI-supported exploration.

        Please stay focused, take your time, and engage actively with the assistant.
        Careful questioning will help you uncover how these manipulative techniques work—and how to recognize them in the real world.
